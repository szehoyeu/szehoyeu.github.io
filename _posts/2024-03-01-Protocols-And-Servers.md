Task 1  Introduction
---

This room introduces the user to a few protocols commonly used, such as:

- HTTP
- FTP
- POP3
- SMTP
- IMAP

Each task about each protocol will be designed to help us understand what happens on the low level and is usually hidden by an elegant GUI (Graphical User Interface). We will “talk” using the above protocols using a simple Telnet client to fully understand what your GUI client is doing under the hood. Our purpose is not to memorize the protocol commands but rather to get a closer look at the protocol while it is working.

We also discuss some of the insecurities. In particular, we focus on passwords sent in cleartext.

Task 2  Telnet
---
The Telnet protocol is an application layer protocol used to connect to a virtual terminal of another computer. Using Telnet, a user can log into another computer and access its terminal (console) to run programs, start batch processes, and perform system administration tasks remotely.

Telnet protocol is relatively simple. When a user connects, they will be asked for a username and password. Upon correct authentication, the user will access the remote system’s terminal. Unfortunately, all this communication between the Telnet client and the Telnet server is not encrypted, making it an easy target for attackers.

A Telnet server uses the Telnet protocol to listen for incoming connections on port 23. (Please note that the Telnet port is not open on the target VM.) Let’s consider the example shown below. A user is connecting to the ```telnetd```, a Telnet server. The steps are as follows:

1. First, he is asked to provide his login name (username). We can see the user entering frank.
2. Then, he is asked for the password, D2xc9CgD. The password is not shown on the screen; however, we display it below for demonstration purposes.
3. Once the system checks his login credentials, he is greeted with a welcome message.
4. And the remote server grants him a command prompt, frank@bento:~$. The $ indicates that this is not a root terminal.

Although Telnet gave us access to the remote system’s terminal in no time, it is not a reliable protocol for remote administration as all the data are sent in cleartext. In the figure below, we captured the traffic generated by Telnet, and it was so easy to find the password. The figure below shows the ASCII data exchanged between our computer and the remote system. The text in red is the text that we are sending to the remote system, while the text in blue is the text that the remote system is sending. Notice how the user name was sent back (echoed at us to display them in our terminal); however, the password was not. In other words, if someone is watching us type, they won’t be able to see the password characters on the screen.

elnet is no longer considered a secure option, especially that anyone capturing your network traffic will be able to discover your usernames and passwords, which would grant them access to the remote system. The secure alternative is SSH, which we present in the next room.


To which port will the telnet command with the default parameters try to connect?
```
23

Task 3  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
---
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used to transfer web pages. Your web browser connects to the webserver and uses HTTP to request HTML pages and images among other files and submit forms and upload various files. Anytime you browse the World Wide Web (WWW), you are certainly using the HTTP protocol.

The image below shows a client requesting the HTML page index.html, which the webserver provides. Then the client requests an image, logo.jpg, and the web server sends it.

![img](/assets/img/protocols-servers02.png)

HTTP sends and receives data as cleartext (not encrypted); therefore, you can use a simple tool, such as Telnet (or Netcat), to communicate with a web server and act as a “web browser”. The key difference is that you need to input the HTTP-related commands instead of the web browser doing that for you.

In the following example, we will see how we can request a page from a web server; moreover, we will discover the webserver version. To accomplish this, we will use the Telnet client. We chose it because Telnet is a simple protocol; furthermore, it uses cleartext for communication. We will use telnet instead of a web browser to request a file from the webserver. The steps will be as follows:

1. First, we connect to port 80 using 
   ```
   telnet MACHINE_IP 80.
   ```
2. Next, we need to type 
   ```
   GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
   ```
   or 
   ```
   GET HTTP/1.1
   ```
   to retrieve the page ```index.html``` or ```GET / HTTP/1.1``` to retrieve the default page.

3. Finally, you need to provide some value for the host like 
   ```
   host: telnet
   ```
   and hit the ```Enter/Return``` key ```twice```.


In the console output below, we could recover the requested page along with a trove of information not usually displayed by the web browser. If the page we requested is not found, we get error 404.


#### Pentester Terminal
```
pentester@TryHackMe$ telnet MACHINE_IP 80
Trying MACHINE_IP...
Connected to MACHINE_IP.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
host: telnet
```
```

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)

```
Of particular interest in the output above is that the user needs only to type a couple of commands to get the page they need: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 followed by host: telnet.

We need an HTTP server (webserver) and an HTTP client (web browser) to use the HTTP protocol. The web server will “serve” a specific set of files to the requesting web browser.

Three popular choices for HTTP servers are:
- Apache
- Internet Information Services (IIS)
- nginx

Apache and Nginx are free and open-source software. However, IIS is closed source software and requires paying for a license.

There are many web browsers available. At the time of writing, the most popular web browsers are:

- Chrome by Google
- Edge by Microsoft
- Firefox by Mozilla
- Safari by Apple.

Web browsers are generally free to install and use; furthermore, tech giants battle for a higher market share for their browsers.
