Task 1  Introduction
---
Subdomain enumeration is the process of finding valid subdomains for a domain, but why do we do this? We do this to expand our attack surface to try and discover more potential points of vulnerability.

We will explore three different subdomain enumeration methods: 
1. Brute Force, 
2. OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
3. Virtual Host.


What is a subdomain enumeration method beginning with B?

```
What is a subdomain enumeration method beginning with V?
```
Virtual Host
