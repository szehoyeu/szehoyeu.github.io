Accessing Your Linux Machince Using SSH (Deploy)
---
In fact, the in-browser functionality uses the exact same protocol that we are going to be using today. This protocol is called Secure Shell or SSH for short and is the common means of connecting to and interacting with the command line of a remote Linux machine.

We will be deploying two machines in this room:

- Your Linux machine
- The TryHackMe AttackBox


What is SSH & how Does it Work?
---

Secure Shell or SSH simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form. Using cryptography, any input we send in a human-readable format is encrypted for travelling over a network -- where it is then unencrypted once it reaches the remote machine, such as in the diagram below.

![SSH](/assets/img/ssh.png)

- SSH allows us to remotely execute commands on another device remotely.
- Any data sent between the devices is encrypted when it is sent over a network such as the Internet
Using SSH to Login to Your Linux Machine

---
The syntax to use SSH is very simple. We only need to provide two things:

1. The IP address of the remote machine
2. Correct credentials to a valid account to login with on the remote machine

```
For this room, we will be logging in as "tryhackme", whose password is "tryhackme" without the quotation ("") marks. Let's use the IP address of the machine displayed in the card at the top of the room as the IP address and this user, to construct a command to log in to the remote machine using SSH. The command to do so is ssh and then the username of the account, @ the IP address of the machine.

But first, we need to open a terminal on the TryHackMe AttackBox. There is an icon placed on the desktop named "Terminal". And now, we can proceed to input commands.
```
For example: ```ssh tryhackme@MACHINE_IP``` . Replacing the IP address with the IP address for your Linux target machine. Once executed, we will then be asked to trust the host and then ```provide a password for the "tryhackme" account, which is also "tryhackme"```.

Introduction to Flags and Switches
---
Using our ls example, ls informs us that there is only one folder named "folder1" as highlighted in the screenshot below. Note that the contents in the screenshots below are only examples.
```
 ls
=>folder1
```

However, after using the```-a``` argument (short for ```--all```), we now suddenly have an output with a few more files and folders such as ".hiddenfolder". 
```Files and folders with "." are hidden files.```
```
ls -a 
.hiddenfolder folder1
```
--help option for ls
```
ls --help
---

Filesystem Interation Continued
---
We covered some of the most fundamental commands when interacting with the filesystem on the Linux machine. For example, we covered how to list and find the contents of folders using ```ls``` and ```find``` and navigating the filesystem using ```cd```. 

In this task, we're going to learn some more commands for interacting with the filesystem to allow us to:-

- create files and folders
- move files and folders
- delete files and folders

![Command ](/assets/img/linux-cmd03.png)


Creating Files and Folders (touch, mkdir)
---
The ```touch``` command takes exactly one argument -- the name we want to give the file we create.

For example, we can create the file "note" by using touch note. It's worth noting that touch simply creates a blank file. 

You would need to use commands like ```echo``` or text editors such as ```nano``` to add content to the blank file.
```
touch note
ls           
=> folder1 note
```

This is a similar process for making a folder, which just involves using the ```mkdir``` command and again providing the name that we want to assign to the directory. 

For example, creating the directory "mydirectory" using mkdir mydirectory.

```
mkdir mydirectory
ls           
mydirectory note folder1
```


Removing Files and Folders (rm)
---
```rm``` is extraordinary out of the commands that we've covered so far. You can simply remove files by using ```rm```. 

However, you need to provide the ```-R ```switch alongside the name of the directory you wish to remove.

```
rm note
ls           
 mydirectory folder1
```

```
rm -R mydirectory
ls           
folder1
```


Copying and Moving Files and Folders (cp, mv)
---
Copying and moving files is an important functionality on a Linux machine. Starting with ```cp```, this command takes two arguments:

1. the name of the existing file

2. the name we wish to assign to the new file when copying

```cp``` copies the entire contents of the existing file into the new file. 

In the screenshot below, we are copying "note" to "note2".

```
cp note note2
ls           
=> folder1 note note2
```

Moving a file
---
Moving a file takes two arguments, just like the cp command. However, rather than copying and/or creating a new file, ```mv``` will ```merge or modify the second file that we provide as an argument```. Not only can you use mv to move a file to a new folder, but you can also use mvto rename a file or folder. 

For example, in the screenshot below, we are renaming the file "note2" to be named "note3". "note3" will now have the contents of "note2". 
```
Using mv to move (rename/merge) a file

mv note2 note3
ls           
folder1 note note3
```
Determining File Type
---
What is often misleading and often catches people out is making presumptions from files as to what their purpose or contents may be. Files usually have what's known as an extension to make this easier. For example, text files usually have an extension of ".txt". But this is not necessary.

So far, the files we have used in our examples haven't had an extension. Without knowing the context of why the file is there -- we don't really know its purpose. Enter the file command. This command takes one argument. 
For example, we'll use file to confirm whether or not the "note" file in our examples is indeed a text file, like so file note.

```
file note
note: ASCII text
```


How would you create the file named "newnote"?
```
touch newnote
```


On the deployable machine, what is the file type of "unknown1" in "tryhackme's" home directory?
```
ASCII text
```

How would we move the file "myfile" to the directory "myfolder" 
```
mv myfile myfolder
```


What are the contents of this file?
```
cat myfile
THM{FILESYSTEM}
```

Permissions 101
---
We learned how to extend the use of commands through flags and switches. Take, for example, the ```ls``` command, which lists the contents of the current directory. When using the ```-l``` switch, we can see ten columns such as in the screenshot below. However, we're only interested in the first three columns:
```
ls -lh
-rw-r--r-- 1 cmnatic cmnatic 0 Feb 19 10:37 file1
-rw-r--r-- 8 cmnatic cmnatic 0 Feb 19 10:37 file2
```

 file or folder can have a couple of characteristics that determine both what actions are allowed and what user or group has the ability to perform the given action -- such as the following:

- Read
- Write
- Execute 

Using ```su``` to switch to user2
```
tryhackme@linux2:~$ su user2
Password:
user2@linux2:/home/tryhackme$
```
Let's use the "cmnatic.pem" file in our initial screenshot at the top of this task. 

It has the "-" indicator highlighting that it is a file and then "rw" followed after. This means that only the owner of the file can read and write to this"cmnatic.pem" file but cannot execute it.

Briefly: The Differences Between Users & Groups
---

We briefly explored this in Linux fundamentals part 1 (namely, the differences between a regular user and a system user). The great thing about Linux is that permissions can be so granular, that whilst a user technically owns a file, if the permissions have been set, then a group of users can also have either the same or a different set of permissions to the exact same file without affecting the file owner itself.

Let's put this into a real-world context; the system user that runs a web server must have permissions to read and write files for an effective web application. However, companies such as web hosting companies will have to want to allow their customers to upload their own files for their website without being the webserver system user -- compromising the security of every other customer. 

We'll learn the commands necessary to switch between users below.

Switching Between Users
---

Switching between users on a Linux install is easy work thanks to the su command. Unless you are the root user (or using root permissions through sudo), then you are required to know two things to facilitate this transition of user accounts:

- The user we wish to switch to
- The user's password

The ```su``` command takes a couple of switches that may be of relevance to you. For example, executing a command once you log in or specifying a specific shell to use. I encourage you to read the man page for ```su``` to find out more. However, I will cover the ```-l``` or ```--login``` switch.

Simply, by providing the ```-l``` switch to ```su```, we start a shell that is much more similar to the actual user logging into the system - we inherit a lot more properties of the new user, i.e., environment variables and the likes. 

```
tryhackme@linux2:~$ su user2
Password:
user2@linux2:/home/tryhackme$
```
For example, when using su to switch to "user2", our new session drops us into our previous user's home directory. 
```
tryhackme@linux2:~$ su -l user2
Password:
user2@linux2:~$ pwd
user2@:/home/user2$
```

Where now, after using ```-l```, our new session has dropped us into the home directory of "user" automatically. 


On the deployable machine, who is the owner of "important"?
```
=>
root@ip-10-10-241-19:~# ssh tryhackme@10.10.80.176

tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls -l
total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 user2     user2       14 May  5  2021 important
-rw-r--r-- 1 tryhackme tryhackme   16 May  5  2021 myfile
drwxr-xr-x 2 tryhackme tryhackme 4096 May  4  2021 myfolder
-rw-r--r-- 1 tryhackme tryhackme   17 May  4  2021 unknown1


```


What would the command be to switch to the user "user2"?
```
su user2

tryhackme@linux2:~$ su -l user2
Password: 
user2@linux2:~$ 

```

Now switch to this user "user2" using the password "user2"
```

```


Output the contents of "important", what is the flag?
```
tryhackme@linux2:~$ cat important
THM{SU_USER2}
```

Common Directories
---
## /etc

This root directory is one of the most important root directories on your system. The ```etc ```folder (short for etcetera) is a commonplace location to ```store system files that are used by your operating system.``` 

For example, the sudoers file highlighted in the screenshot below contains a list of the users & groups that have permission to run ```sudo``` or a set of commands as the root user.

Also highlighted below are the ```"passwd"``` and ```"shadow"``` files. These two files are special for Linux as they show how your system stores the passwords for each user in encrypted formatting called ```sha512```.

```
ls
shadow passwd sudoers sudoers.d
```

## /var

The "/var" directory, with "var" being short for ```variable data``,  is one of the main root folders found on a Linux install. 

This folder stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system. 

For example, 

log files from running services and applications are written here ```(/var/log)```, or other data that is not necessarily associated with a specific user (i.e., databases and the like).

```
tryhackme@linux2:/var$ ls
backups log opt tmp
```

# /root

Unlike the /home directory, the ```/root folder``` is actually the home for the "root" system user. There isn't anything more to this folder other than just understanding that this is ```the home directory for the "root" user```. But, it is worth a mention as the logical presumption is that this user would have their data in a directory such as ```"/home/root"``` by default.  

# /tmp

This is a ```unique root directory``` found on a Linux install. Short for ```"temporary"```, the /tmp directory is volatile and is used to store data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice. Similar to the memory on your computer, ```once the computer is restarted, the contents of this folder are cleared out.```

What's useful for us in pentesting is that any user can write to this folder by default. Meaning once we have access to a machine, it serves as a good place to store things like our enumeration scripts.

```
root@linux2:/tmp# ls
todelete trash.txt rubbish.bin
```

What is the directory path that would we expect logs to be stored in?
```
/var/log
```


What root directory is similar to how RAM on a computer works?
```
/tmp
```

Name the home directory of the root user 
```
/root
```
