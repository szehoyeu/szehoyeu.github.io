I am an IT system administrator at Prolacta Bioscience, where I manage and monitor the IT systems and servers for a company that produces human milk-based products for premature infants. I have a masterâ€™s degree in electrical engineering from USC and a passion for learning new technologies and skills.

I have over 10 years of experience in IT systems and web development, and I am proficient in various tools and platforms, such as Azure, PowerShell, Power Automate, Veeam, Intune, Barracuda, Palo Alto Firewall, SOC, and cybersecurity. I have successfully completed various projects, such as a web app, a chatbot, a calculator, and a game, which I showcase on my Github personal page. I also write a blog where I share my knowledge and insights on various topics, such as Azure, PowerShell, Power Automate, Veeam, Intune, and more.

I have a strong faith in Jesus and I try to practice my faith by praying, reading the Bible, listening to Christian music, and watching online sermons. I also plan to go to church more often, as I believe it can help me strengthen my faith and connect with other believers.

I have a very active and healthy lifestyle, as I love playing basketball, swimming, and running. I run more than 16 miles a week only on weekends. I also like meditation before sleep, as it helps me relax and improve my well-being.

I have a big and lovely family, with three children and five dogs. My son is Aidan, and my daughters are Michelle and Abbie. The dogs are Luffy, Jackie, Chewy, DingDing, and Mickey. They are all growing up fast and they keep me busy and happy.
