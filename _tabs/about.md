I have experience in IT systems and web development, and I am proficient in various tools and platforms, such as Azure, PowerShell, Power Automate, Veeam, Intune, Barracuda, Palo Alto Firewall, SOC, and cybersecurity. I like to learn as a habit and thanks Github to provide a platform for my personal page, so I can share my knowledge and insights on various topics, such as Azure, PowerShell, Power Automate, Veeam, Intune, and more.

I love playing basketball, swimming, and running. I also like meditation before sleep, as it helps me relax and improve my well-being.

I am grateful to have a big and lovely family, with three children and five dogs. My wife, Ada, my son, Aidan, and my daughters are Michelle and Abbie. The dogs are Luffy, Jackie, Chewy, DingDing, and Mickey. They are all growing up fast and they keep me busy and happy.

Heavenly Father,
I come before You today to pray for my family. Thank You for their presence in my life. I ask that You bless them with Your love and grace. Protect them from harm, guide their steps, and provide for their needs. Help us to support each other, to love unconditionally, and to grow in faith together. May our home be filled with peace, joy, and Your divine presence.
In Jesus' Name, Amen.
